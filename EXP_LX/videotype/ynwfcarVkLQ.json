down drinks,", "start": 20.32, "duration": 4.1}, {"text": "and it isn't because they are cold.", "start": 24.42, "duration": 2.19}, {"text": "Put differently, an ice cube\nwhich would be at -10\u00b0C (14\u00b0F),", "start": 26.62, "duration": 3.559}, {"text": "wouldn't cool down much more than one at 0\u00b0C (32\u00b0F).", "start": 30.179, "duration": 3.911}, {"text": "So to understand this, we have to come back\nto the idea of cooling something.", "start": 34.09, "duration": 3.71}, {"text": "When we put together a warm body and a cold body,", "start": 37.8, "duration": 2.7}, {"text": "some heat will be transferred\nfrom the hot body to the cold one", "start": 40.5, "duration": 3.38}, {"text": "and this ability of the cold body to absorb\nheat by increasing its temperature,", "start":

that to melt, the ice cube\nhas to take heat from the drink.", "start": 82.78, "duration": 3.64}, {"text": "And the amount of heat it takes at this stage\nis called 'fusion heat',", "start": 86.42,

3300 J to melt.", "start": 96.52, "duration": 3.64}, {"text": "So if we total this, my ice that changes\nfrom -10\u00b0C to 0\u00b0C takes 200 J", "start": 100.17, "duration": 4.67}, {"text": "and then the simple fact of melting takes 3300 J.", "start": 104.84, "duration": 3.92}, {"text": "You see that almost all the cooling power\nof my ice cube", "start": 108.77, "duration": 4.19}, {"text":

have a significantly worse cooling power.", "start": 119.14, "duration": 2.59}, {"text": "So it works not well, unless they are pretty massive,", "start": 121.73, "duration": 3.0}, {"text": "they are
