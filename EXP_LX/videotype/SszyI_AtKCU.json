{"text": "Today, I will explain you why in any glass of water", "start": 3.72, "duration": 3.62}, {"text": "you can always find molecules that in the past", "start": 7.34, "duration": 3.16}, {"text": "were already drunk by Julius Cesar.", "start": 11.1, "duration": 1.9}, {"text": "I have here a glass of water", "start": 18.82, "duration": 2.4}, {"text": "and you know that water is composed\nof water molecules H2O,", "start": 21.22, "duration": 2.94}, {"text": "two atoms of hydrogen and one of oxygen.", "start": 24.16, "duration": 2.14}, {"text": "So, you should know that water molecules are really small\nbecause they have a size of about 0.3 nanometers,", "start": 26.3, "duration": 6.62}, {"text": "It's smaller than a millionth of millimeter.", "start": 32.92, "duration": 3.98}, {"text": "It's not easy to imagine such small sizes.", "start": 36.9, "duration": 4.0}, {"text": "An easier way of thinking about it is to ask yourself.", "start": 40.9, "duration": 2.22}, {"text": "In a glass of water like this one", "start": 43.12, "duration": 1.76}, {"text": "how many water molecule are there?", "start": 44.88, "duration": 1.76}, {"text": "There is a pretty easy way of calculating it.", "start": 47.06, "duration": 2.22}, {"text": "We know the mass of a water molecule\nand I know what mass of water I have in my glass,", "start": 49.28, "duration": 3.2}, {"text": "so I can do a simple division.", "start": 52.48, "duration": 1.84}, {"text": "And if we do this, we find out\nthat in a glass of about 300ml", "start": 54.32, "duration": 4.04}, {"text": "there are about 10 power 25\nwater molecules.", "start": 58.36, "duration": 4.06}, {"text": "10 power 25 is an astronomic number,\nit's 1 followed by 25 0s.", "start": 62.42, "duration": 4.98}, {"text": "For example, it's more than\nthe number of grains of sand on earth", "start": 67.4, "duration": 2.62}, {"text": "and all of this in my glass of water.", "start": 70.02, "duration": 2.78}, {"text": "So now, let us think about Julius Caesar,", "start": 73.34, "duration": 3.12}, {"text": "and particularly about the last glass that\nhe drank just before being murdered.", "start": 76.46, "duration": 4.62}, {"text": "So, this last glass, if it was like mine,", "start": 81.52, "duration": 3.08}, {"text": "also contains 10 power 25\nwater molecules.", "start": 84.6, "duration": 3.16}, {"text": "The question that I'm asking myself is that,", "start": 88.44, "duration": 2.38}, {"text": "among these 10 power 25 molecules\nwhich were in the last glass of Julius Caesar,", "start": 90.82, "duration": 3.86}, {"text": "is there, by chance, one\nwhich is in my glass today ?", "start": 94.68, "duration": 5.84}, {"text": "So, in fact, to estimate this,", "start": 101.7, "duration": 1.88}, {"text": "we're going to suppose that all of\nthe molecule in the last glass of Caesar,", "start": 104.32, "duration": 3.88}, {"text": "are spread all over the planet today.", "start": 108.2, "duration": 3.2}, {"text": "It's not completely ridiculous to think that because there is the water cycle, rains,", "start": 111.4, "duration": 4.22}, {"text": "ocean currents, and this happened two thousand years ago.", "start": 115.62, "duration": 2.58}, {"text": "So, we're going to suppose that", "start": 118.2, "duration": 1.76}, {"text": "all of these molecules of the glass of Caesar, are today completely diluted in Earth's water.", "start": 119.96, "duration": 4.38}, {"text": "But what is the quantity of water on earth?", "start": 125.12, "duration": 2.44}, {"text": "That's quite easy to calculate.", "start": 127.56, "duration": 1.94}, {"text": "You won't be surprised to hear that nearly all of the water on the planet is in the oceans, the seas.", "start": 129.5, "duration": 4.52}, {"text": "We know that seas and oceans\nare about 4 to 5 kilometers deep", "start": 134.36, "duration": 3.66}, {"text": "and cover 70% of Earth's surface.", "start": 138.02, "duration": 2.6}, {"text": "So, if we do the math,", "start": 140.62, "duration": 1.46}, {"text": "we find that on earth, there are about\n10 power 21 liters of water.", "start": 142.1, "duration": 5.26}, {"text": "10 power 21 liters is\none thousand of billions of billions of liters.", "start": 147.8, "duration": 4.28}, {"text": "Except that, one minute ago,\nI told you that in Caesar's last glass,", "start": 152.68, "duration": 2.22}, {"text": "there were 10 power 25 molecules of water.", "start": 154.9, "duration": 2.62}, {"text": "So if we assume that these 10 power 25 molecules of water,", "start": 157.52, "duration": 2.98}, {"text": "are today totally diluted in Earth's water,", "start": 160.5, "duration": 2.8}, {"text": "I can calculate that, on average,\nin each liter of water on the planet,", "start": 163.3, "duration": 3.42}, {"text": "there are about 10000 molecules\nwhich were in Cesar's last glass.", "start": 166.72, "duration": 4.06}, {"text": "10000 molecules per liter of water,", "start": 171.22, "duration": 2.02}, {"text": "it means that in my own glass,\nwhich contains 200 to 300ml,", "start": 173.24, "duration": 3.4}, {"text": "there would be about 2000 to 3000 molecules which were in Caesar's last glass.", "start": 176.64, "duration": 5.34}, {"text": "I don't know about you but it amazes me.", "start": 181.98, "duration": 2.4}, {"text": "Obviously, the reasoning isn't specific\nfor Caesar's last glass at all.", "start": 184.38, "duration": 3.54}, {"text": "I could have taken the glass before last, his 1000th glass", "start": 187.92, "duration": 3.22}, {"text": "or even his first baby bottle, it would be the same.", "start": 191.14, "duration": 2.34}, {"text": "Obviously, it also work with Louis XIV, Napoleon,", "start": 193.48, "duration": 3.6}, {"text": "it even works with Jesus' last glass.", "start": 197.08, "duration": 2.32}, {"text": "I hope, now that you know it,", "start": 199.8, "duration": 1.46}, {"text": "you'll look at your glasses of water differently before drinking them,", "start": 201.26, "duration": 2.3}, {"text": "thinking about the famous men\nof the past who are there.", "start": 203.56, "duration": 2.84}, {"text": "Thank you for
